# Hello, World!

Create a file called `hello.rb` and put the following code into it:

```ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

This is a ruby program, albeit a very small one. To run a ruby program, from the command line, you pass the name of the file containing the program that you want Ruby to run for you, like this:

    .terminal
    $ ruby hello.rb
    Hello, World!

As you can see, the Ruby program printed out the string `Hello, World!`

---

# Interactive Ruby

Ruby provides an interactive shell called **IRB**. In IRB, you can enter small pieces of Ruby code and see what it evaluates to. Open the file '~/.irbrc` using Sublime Text:

    .terminal
    subl ~/.irbrc

and copy and paste the following code into that file and save it:

```ruby
require 'irb/completion'

# History
IRB.conf[:PROMPT_MODE] = :SIMPLE
IRB.conf[:SAVE_HISTORY] = 100
IRB.conf[:HISTORY_FILE] = "#{ENV['HOME']}/.irb-save-history"
IRB.conf[:AUTO_INDENT] = true
```

Now you can launch IRB like this:

    .terminal
    $ irb
    >>

The `>>` prompt indicates you are now in the IRB shell instead of Bash. Use the IRB shell to follow along with the examples in these slides.

When you type in a command and press enter, IRB will show you the result starting with a `=>`

---

# Objects

All values in Ruby are Objects.  The type of an object is determined by its class.

## Strings

    .terminal
    >> "Hello World"
    => "Hello World"
    >> "Hello World".class
    => String

## Integers

    .terminal
    >> 42
    => 42
    >> 42.class
    => Fixnum

## Floating Point Numbers

    .terminal
    >> 3.14159
    => 3.14159
    >> 3.14159.class
    => Float

There are lots more we will learn...
---

# Expressions

Expressions evaluate to an Object

## Mathematical Operators

    .terminal
    >> 41 + 1
    => 42
    >> 43 - 1
    => 42
    >> 6 * 7
    => 42
    >> 210 / 5
    => 42
    >> 42 % 10
    => 2
---

# Expressions

## Boolean Operators

Equality

    .terminal
    >> 42 == 42
    => true
    >> 42 == 21 * 2
    => true
    >> 42 != 10
    => true

Different types of objects are not equal

    .terminal
    >> 42 == "42"
    => false

Comparison

    >> 5 > 2
    => true
    >> 6 <= 5
    => false

---

# true and false

Boolean expressions return an Object that is either `true` or `false`. Each of these objects have their own class:

    .terminal
    >> true.class
    => TrueClass
    >> false.class
    => FalseClass

These two objects are both commonly referred to as booleans even though they don't have the same Class.

---

# nil

Another basic type is `nil`, which also has it's own class `NilClass`:

    .terminal
    >> nil.class
    => NilClass

`nil` is the value in Ruby that represents "nothing" or "no value". Even though it represents "nothing" or "no value", it still is an Object.

---

# Expressions

## String Operators

The `+` operator concatenates strings together into a new string

    .terminal
    >> "Hello" + " " + "World"
    => "Hello World"

The `<<` operator appends to a string

    .terminal
    >> "Hello" << " World"
    => "Hello World"

Interpolation allows you to include the result of evaluating an expression in a String

    .terminal
    >> "40 + 2 = #{40 + 2}"
    => "40 + 2 = 42"

If you don't want interpolation to occur, use single quotes or precede the `#` with `\`

    .terminal
    >> '40 + 2 = #{40 + 2}'
    => "40 + 2 = \#{40 + 2}"

---

# String Formatting

Another operator you can use with String is the [format operator][format], which is the `%` character. You use the format operator like this:

    .terminal
    >> "%.2f" % 9.9
    => "9.90"

In this example, the string on the left side of the `%` is treated as a format specification, which has special characters that start with a `%` in the string. On the right side of the `%` are the values you want used in the formatted string that is the result of the operation. In this case, we are saying that we want to have a floating point number always formatted with 2 decimal points.

You can have multiple values interpolated into a format specification by supplying an Array, like this:

    .terminal
    >> "%-20s $%.2f" % ['Soap', 0.9]
    => "Soap                 $0.90"

In this example, we are saying we want the string printed and then padded with empty spaces up to 20 characters, and then a dollar sign followed by the floating point number with 2 decimal places.

There is quite a bit you can do with the format, you can read more about in [the Ruby docs for the sprintf methods][sprintf].

The formatting operator is used extensively in programs that will output text in the command line. Since almost everyone uses a [fixed-width font][fixed-width] in a terminal, the spacing can be used to produce alignment to make the output more readable.

[format]: http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/String.html#method-i-25
[sprintf]: http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Kernel.html#method-i-sprintf
[fixed-width]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font
---

# Variables

Variables are named referenced to objects. You create a variable by assigning an Object to it.

    .terminal
    >> my_name = "Paul"
    => "Paul"
    >> my_name
    => "Paul"
    >> my_name == "Paul"
    => true
    >> my_name == 42
    => false

Shorthand for incrementing a variable

    .terminal
    >> i = 0
    => 0
    >> i += 1
    => 1

Equivalent to

    .terminal
    >> i = i + 1
    => 2

---

# Dynamic Typing

Ruby is said to have "dynamic typing" because you can assign any type of Object to the same variable

    .terminal
    >> x = "hello"
    => "hello"
    >> x = 42
    => 42
    >> x = 3.14159
    => 3.14159

In other some other languages (C/Java), you must declare what type of objects can be assigned to a variable. A compiler will check This is known as "static typing".

```java
String x = "hello";
x = "world";
x = 42;
```

    .terminal
    $ javac Example.java
    Example.java:5: incompatible types
    found   : int
    required: java.lang.String
        x = 42;
            ^
    1 error

---

# Arrays

Arrays are Objects that are an ordered collection of Objects

    .terminal
    >> [42,99,100]
    => [42,99,100]
    >> some_numbers = [42,99,100]
    => [42,99,100]
    >> some_numbers == [42,99,100]
    => true

Arrays are indexed starting with 0.  Think of the index as the offset from the first element.

    .terminal
    >> some_numbers[0]
    => 42
    >> some_numbers[2]
    => 100

You can add elements to an Array

    .terminal
    >> some_numbers << 2001
    => [42, 99, 100, 2001]
    >> some_numbers[3]
    => 2001

---

# Array Values

An Array can hold values of any type of Object and they don't have to be of the same type:

    .terminal
    >> a = [1, "Hello", nil, false]
    => [1, "Hello", nil, false]

Because an Array can contain any Object, it can contain other Arrays, as well as more complex types that we learn about later like Symbols, Hashes, Objects, Classes, etc:

    .terminal
    >> [[1,2], :foo, { x: 1, y: 2}, Object.new, Object]
    => [[1, 2], :foo, {:x=>1, :y=>2}, #<Object:0x007feb121394a8>, Object]

---

# Objects can change

You can assign new objects to a variable

    .terminal
    >> my_name = "John"
    => "John"

Some operators modify the object

    .terminal
    >> my_name << " Doe"
    => "John Doe"
    >> my_name
    => "John Doe"

Some operators return a new object

    .terminal
    >> my_name = "John"
    => "John"
    >> my_name + " Doe"
    => "John Doe"
    >> my_name
    => "John"

---

# Multiple variables can refer to the same object

If the object changes, since these variables are referring to the same object, you see the change in both variables

    .terminal
    >> my_name = "John"
    => "John"
    >> name = my_name
    => "John"
    >> my_name << " Doe"
    => "John Doe"
    >> name
    => "John Doe"

![Diagram](img/reference_diagram.png)

---

# Constants

Constants begin with a capital letter and are variables that you don't intend to change

    .terminal
    >> NAME = "Paul"
    => "Paul"

You will get a warning if you change a constant

    .terminal
    >> NAME = "John"
    (irb):5: warning: already initialized constant NAME
    (irb):4: warning: previous definition of NAME was here

The Object the constant refers to can change

    .terminal
    => "John"
    >> NAME << " Doe"
    => "John Doe"
    >> NAME
    => "John Doe"

Although that is not typical

---

# When to use constants

Constants are good to use when you have a value that doesn't ever change and you might use in multiple places in your program. Even if you are only using it in one place, it's good to give a name to what the value represents, rather than using a [magic number][magic-number].

For example, you could write this method like this:

```ruby
def circumference(radius)
  2 * 3.141592653589793 * radius
end
```

But it would better to do this:

```ruby
PI = 3.141592653589793

def circumference(radius)
  2 * PI * radius
end
```

FYI, for this particular constant, Ruby already has it defined for you in the constant [Math::PI][pi].

[magic-number]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Unnamed_numerical_constants

[pi]: http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Math.html#PI

# Symbols

Used for labeling things in code

    .terminal
    >> :paul
    => :paul
    >> :paul.class
    => Symbol

Symbols are similar to Strings

    .terminal
    >> my_name = :paul
    => :paul
    >> "Hello #{my_name}"
    => "Hello paul"

but Symbols are not the same type as Strings, so they are not equal to Strings

    .terminal
    >> :paul == "paul"
    => false

---

# Symbols vs. Strings

The concept of Symbols vs. Strings is confusing to most people when first learnign Ruby. Another way to think of it is to think of Integers vs. Strings. As we said earlier, values must be of the same type to be considered equal:

    .terminal
    >> 42 == 42
    => true
    >> 42 == "42"
    => false

The Integer forty-two is equal to the Integer forty-two, but the Integer forty-two is not equal to a string with the digits 4 and 2.

Symbols and Strings have a similar relationship in that they are a like in a lot of ways, but still not the same class and therefore not equal. This can be confusing sometimes because you might have something like this, where you have a variable `name` that is declared elsewhere in the program:

    .terminal
    >> "Hello #{name}"
    => "Hello paul"
    >> name == "paul"
    => false

And you are expecting it to be a String, but it is actually a Symbol. Check the class of the Object to determine if that is the case:

    .terminal
    >> name.class
    => Symbol

---

# When to use a Symbol instead of a String

Once you understand the difference between Symbols and Strings, the next question you might have would be when should I use a Symbol instead of a String?

Once you understand more about the Ruby language, it will be easier to explain the difference. For now, just understand that there is a difference and be able to recognize in code examples that `:this` is a Symbol and `"this"` is a String and they are not the same thing.

If feel you are ready for a deep dive into this subject, try reading [this article](http://www.troubleshooters.com/codecorn/ruby/symbols.htm), but just being able to distinguish between the two is enough when you are getting started building Rails app. I suggest bookmarking that article for further reading after we've covered Ruby in more detail.

# Hashes

A collection of objects named with keys

    .terminal
    >> { :name => "Paul", :age => 35 }
    => {:name=>"Paul", :age=>35}

More concise Syntax new in Ruby 1.9+. You can only use this syntax when you want the keys to be Symbols:

    .terminal
    >> { name: "Paul", age: 35 }
    => {:name=>"Paul", :age=>35}

You can use Strings or any other object for the keys, but Symbols are most common

    .terminal
    >> { "name" => "Paul", "age" => 35 }
    => {"name"=>"Paul", "age"=>35}

---

# Hash Operators

    >> person = { name: "Paul", age: 35 }
    => {:name=>"Paul", :age=>35}

Get the value for a key

    >> person[:name]
    => "Paul"

Assign a value to a key

    >> person[:city] = "Baltimore"
    => "Baltimore"
    >> person
    => {:name=>"Paul", :age=>35, :city=>"Baltimore"}

If there is no key, you get nil

    .terminal
    >> person[:email]
    => nil
    >> x = nil
    => nil
    >> x.class
    => NilClass

---

# Symbol keys vs. Strings keys

Since Symbols aren't equal to Strings, you can't get an object from a Hash using a Symbol if the keys are Strings:

    .terminal
    >> person = { name: "Paul" }
    => {:name=>"Paul"}
    >> person[:name]
    => "Paul"
    >> person["name"]
    => nil

or vice-versa, if the keys are Strings, you can't access the values using Symbols:

    .terminal
    >> person = { "name" => "Paul" }
    => {"name"=>"Paul"}
    >> person["name"]
    => "Paul"
    >> person[:name]
    => nil

---

# Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are patterns. You can use them to see if a String matches a Regular Expression:

    .terminal
    >> /oo/.class
    => Regexp
    >> "food" =~ /oo/
    => 1
    >> "food" =~ /^foo/
    => 0
    >> "food" =~ /d$/
    => 3
    >> "food" =~ /foo$/
    => nil
    >> "food" !~ /foo$/
    => true

Other mainstream programming languages, such as Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, Perl and more, also have Regular Expressions.

Regular Expressions can get insanely complex. For an example, look at this [regular expression for validating an email address](http://stackoverflow.com/a/719543).

To learn more about Regular Expressions, check out the [Ruby for Newbies: Regular Expressions](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby-for-newbies-regular-expressions--net-19812) tutorial.

# Basic Ruby Types

```ruby
# String
"Hello, World!"

# Integer
42

# Float
3.14159

# Boolean
true

# Symbol
:name

# Regexp
/\d/

# Array
[42,99,100]

# Hash
{ :name => "Paul", :age => 35 }

# nil
nil
```

---

# Conditional Statements

`if [condition] then [then expression] else [else expression] end`

    .terminal
    >> x = 42
    => 42
    >> if x > 40 then 1 else 0 end
    => 1

The `else` is optional

    .terminal
    >> if x > 40 then 1 end
    => 1

`unless` is the opposite of `if`

    .terminal
    >> unless x > 40 then 1 end
    => nil

The conditional can be at the end of the line

    .terminal
    >> 1 unless x > 40
    => nil

---

# Truthiness

`nil` and `false` are considered to be "falsy", everything else is "truthy"

    .terminal
    >> x = 42
    => 42
    >> if x then "yes" else "no" end
    => "yes"
    >> x = 0
    => 0
    >> if x then "yes" else "no" end
    => "yes"
    >> x = "false"
    => "false"
    >> if x then 1 else 0 end
    => 1
    >> x = false
    => false
    >> if x then 1 else 0 end
    => 0
    >> x = nil
    => nil
    >> if x then 1 else 0 end
    => 0

---

# Methods

All Objects have methods. You can call a method with `object.method`

    .terminal
    >> "hello".upcase
    => "HELLO"

Methods can have arguments

    .terminal
    >> 5.remainder(2)
    => 1

The methods that an object has are determined by what type of Object it is

# Methods Are Messages

    .terminal
    >> "hello".send(:upcase)
    => "HELLO"
    >> 5.send(:remainder, 2)
    => 1

Every method call is really sending a message to an Object

---

# Object Methods

Determine what type of Object it is

    .terminal
    >> :hello.class
    => Symbol
    >> nil.class
    => NilClass

Ask an object if it is a a certain type

    .terminal
    >> :hello.is_a?(Symbol)
    => true
    >> :hello.is_a?(Object)
    => true
    >> :hello.is_a?(String)
    => false

Methods that end in a question mark are usually methods that return `true` or `false` as the answer to a "question"

---

# Object Methods

Get the string representation of an Object

    .terminal
    >> :hello.to_s
    => "hello"
    >> nil.to_s
    => ""

Get a more detailed representation of an Object for debugging

    .terminal
    >> :hello.inspect
    => ":hello"
    >> nil.inspect
    => "nil"

---

# Object Methods

Create a copy of the Object

    .terminal
    >> my_name = "John"
    => "John"
    >> name = my_name.dup
    => "John"
    >> my_name << " Doe"
    => "John Doe"

The original Object has been modified

    .terminal
    >> my_name
    => "John Doe"

The copy has not

    .terminal
    >> name
    => "John"

---

# Object Methods

Freeze an object so it cannot be changed

    .terminal
    >> name.freeze
    => "John"
    >> name << " Doe"
    RuntimeError: can't modify frozen String
      from (irb):38
      from /Users/pbarry/.rbenv/versions/2.0.0-p0/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

---

# String Methods

Change the case of characters in a String

    .terminal
    >> "hello".capitalize
    >> "Hello"
    >> "hello".upcase
    => "HELLO"
    >> "hello".upcase.downcase
    => "hello"

Split a String into an Array

    .terminal
    >> "hello word".split
    => ["hello", "world"]
    >> "hello, world!".split(',')
    => ["hello", " world!"]

Remove whitespace from the beginning and the end

    .terminal
    >> "  hello  ".strip
    => "hello"


---

# String Methods

Replace parts of a String

    .terminal
    >> "hello world".sub('hello','goodbye')
    => "goodbye world"

Replace all occurrences of a String

    .terminal
    >> "one two one".sub('one','three')
    => "three two one"
    >> "one two one".gsub('one','three')
    => "three two three"

Get a "slice" of a String

    .terminal
    >> "hello world".slice(0)
    => "h"
    >> "hello world".slice(-1)
    => "d"
    >> "hello world".slice(4,4)
    => "o wo"

---

# String Methods

Convert to an Integer

    .terminal
    >> "42".to_i
    => 42

Convert to a Float

    .terminal
    >> "3.14159".to_f
    => 3.14159

Convert to a Symbol

    .terminal
    >> "hello".to_sym
    => :hello

    => 3.14

---

# Array Methods

    .terminal
    >> a = [42,99,100]
    => [42, 99, 100]

Determine how many elements are in the Array

    .terminal
    >> a.size
    => 3
    >> a.length
    => 3

Join an Array into a String separated by a character

    .terminal
    >> a.join(',')
    => "42,99,100"

Get the first/last elements of an array

    .terminal
    >> a.first
    => 42
    >> a.last
    => 100

---

# Array Methods

Add/remove an element from the end of the Array

    .terminal
    >> a.push 120
    => [42, 99, 100, 120]
    >> a.pop
    => 120
    >> a
    => [42, 99, 100]

Add/remove an element from the front of the Array

    .terminal
    >> a.unshift 1
    => [1, 42, 99, 100]
    >> a.shift
    => 1
    >> a
    => [42, 99, 100]

# Array Methods

Remove an element from the Array

    .terminal
    => a = [42, 99, 100]
    >> a.delete 100
    => 100
    >> a
    => [42, 99]

Find the index of an element in the Array

    .terminal
    >> a.index(99)
    => 1

Remove an element from the Array by index

    .terminal
    >> a.delete_at(1)
    => 99
    >> a
    => [42]

# Hash Methods

    .terminal
    >> person = { name: "Paul", age: 35 }
    => {:name=>"Paul", :age=>35}

Get the keys of the Hash

    .terminal
    >> person.keys
    => [:name, :age]

Get the values of the Hash

    .terminal
    >> person.values
    => ["Paul", 35]

---

# Hash Methods

Merge hashes

    .terminal
    >> person.merge(name: "Paul Barry", city: "Baltimore")
    => {:name=>"Paul Barry", :age=>35, :city=>"Baltimore"}

`merge` returns a new Hash, does not modify the Hash

    >> person
    => {:name=>"Paul", :age=>35}

`merge!` modifies the Hash

    >> person.merge!(name: "Paul Barry", city: "Baltimore")
    => {:name=>"Paul Barry", :age=>35, :city=>"Baltimore"}
    >> person
    => {:name=>"Paul Barry", :age=>35, :city=>"Baltimore"}

Having two versions of a method, one that ends without an exclamation mark and does not modify the Object and another that ends with an exclamation mark that does modify the Object, is a common idiom

# Writing your own methods

Like any programming language, Ruby allows you to define your own methods. Methods are usually more than one line, so at this point in the tutorial, we're going to switch over to save our code into a file and running the program.

Open a new Ruby file named anything you want, `code.rb`, for example, in Sublime Text:

    .terminal
    $ subl code.rb

Put the following code in the file:

```ruby
puts RUBY_VERSION
```

And run it from the bash command line (not IRB), like this:

    .terminal
    $ ruby code.rb
    2.1.0

More conveniently, once you have saved the file in Sublime Text, you can press command-b to run the program from within Sublime Text. The output will look like this:

    .terminal
    2.1.0
    [Finished in 0.5s]

You will see this output in a small window at the bottom of Sublime Text. You can press ESC to close that output window. Sublime Text puts some additional output that indicates how long the program took to run in the output window. You can ignore that.

---

# Defining Methods

You define a method using the **def** keyword, like this:

```ruby
def say_hello
  puts "Hello Paul"
end
```

The name of the method follows def. When you write the above code, the method is not executed, it is only defined, saved for later under the name `say_hello`.

To call the method, put a few more lines of code in the same file, below the `end` that corresponds to the `def`, like this:

```ruby
say_hello
```

When you run the program, the output will be:

    .terminal
    Hello Paul

---

# Method Arguments

Methods can have one or more arguments. You specify a name for each argument your method will accept in parentheses after the method name. The argument is then available as a variable that is equal to the value you pass in when you call the method while the body of the method is executed.

```ruby
def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}"
end
```

Put a few more lines of code in the same file to call the method that you defined three times, each time with a different value for the argument:

```ruby
say_hello "Peter"
say_hello "Paul"
say_hello "Mary"
```

The output will be:

    .terminal
    Hello Peter
    Hello Paul
    Hello Mary

---

# Local Variables

An import concept to understand about variables is called **scoping**, which refers to the context which a variable is available. Put this code into your program:

```ruby
def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}"
end

say_hello "Paul"
puts name
```

Run the program from the bash command line instead of from within Sublime Text and the output will look like this:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ ruby code.rb
    Hello Paul
    code.rb:6:in `<main>': undefined local variable or method `name' for main:Object (NameError)

]

Before we go over local variables and scoping, let's go over how to read error messages like this.

_(you can run this program from within Sublime Text and you will also get an error, but the output is a little more confusing, so I suggest running the program from the command line while learning about exceptions and exception handling)_
---

# Exceptions

The error on the previous slide looked like this:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ ruby code.rb
    Hello Paul
    code.rb:6:in `<main>': undefined local variable or method `name' for main:Object (NameError)

]

After the `say_hello` method is successfully called, the next line **raises an exception**. When that happens, the name of the file and the line number of where the exception occurred is the first thing printed out in the error message. From this we can tell the exception is on line 6 of `code.rb`.

After that is the exception message, which in this case is:

    .terminal
    `<main>': undefined local variable or method `name' for main:Object

These messages can be helpful for debugging the error. Before we discuss this specific error, let's go over errors in a little more detail.

The last part of the error message tells us which class the exception is. In this case it is a `NameError`.

---

# Unhandled Exceptions

Sometimes in programs we might have to call code where an exception could be raised. Imagine trying to download something from the Internet via Ruby code. If the network is down, the code will raise an exception.

The way this code is written right now, this error is referred to as an **unhandled exception**. When you have an unhandled exception in your program, your program stops (a.k.a crashes). In this example, if we have more code after line 6, it would never be reached, because the program would crash. Let's add some code to demonstrate that:

```ruby
def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}"
end

say_hello "Paul"
puts name
say_hello "Peter"
```

When you run this, you will get the same error and "`Hello Peter`" will not be in the output, because the exception is on line 6, so that program crashes at the point and line 7 is never reached.

---

# Handling Exception

If you don't want your program to crash when there is an Exception, you can use the `begin` and `rescue` keywords, like this:

```ruby
def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}"
end

say_hello "Paul"
begin
  puts name
rescue NameError => ex
  puts "oops, there was a #{ex.class} exception"
end
say_hello "Peter"
```

The output will be:

    .terminal
    Hello Paul
    oops, there was a NameError exception
    Hello Peter

The `begin` keyword start a block of code that will be executed. If a NameError is raised in the begin block, the program will assign the exception to the variable `ex`, execute the contents of the rescue block and then continue executing the rest of the program.

If a different class of Exception is raised in the begin block, the raise block will not be executed and the exception will be treated as an unhandled exception, meaning your program will crash.

---

# Back to local variables

So now that we know what happens when your program encounters an error, let's talk about why there is an error in this case. Let's restore the program back the original example that caused the error:

```ruby
def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}"
end

say_hello "Paul"
puts name
```

When you follow the execution path of this code, you might think that in the first 3 lines, the `say_hello` method is defined, then when we call `say_hello` on line 5, the variable name is set to `"Paul"`, so on the next line, we should be able to refer to the name variable, right?

No, what actually happens is that variables defined inside a method, including the ones defined as arguments, are called **local variables**. When the method starts executing, the `name` variable is set to `"Paul"` and it remains set while the `say_hello` method is executing, but once the method is done being executed the variable goes **out of scope**, meaning the variable is no longer defined, which is why the `NameError` exception is raised.

You can think of local variables as variables that temporarily exist while the method is being executed, but cease to exist once the method is finished being executed.

---

# Stack Traces

Try entering this program and running it from the command line:

```ruby
def foo
  puts oops
end

def bar
  foo
end

bar
```

The output will look like this:

.small[

    .terminal
    $ ruby test.rb
    test.rb:2:in `foo': undefined local variable or method `oops' for main:Object (NameError)
        from test.rb:6:in `bar'
        from test.rb:9:in `<main>'

]

The error message is multiple lines. The actual error is on line 2, but the following lines in the error method tell us how we got to the point where the exception occurred. The way to read this is that the error occurred on line 2 in the `foo` method, which was called on line 6 from the `bar` method, which was called on line 9 from the main part of the program.

These kinds of error messages are called **stack traces** and are invaluable when debugging larger programs.

---

# Executing code multiple times

What should you do if you want to call the `say_hello` for 3 different, or 10 different names? You could just add multiple lines of code, like this:

```ruby
def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}"
end

say_hello "Peter"
say_hello "Paul"
say_hello "Mary"
```

This will work, as you would expect, but there is a better way to do this

---

# Iterating over elements in an Array

If we put each of names we want to say hello to in an Array, we can loop through each element of the Array and pass the element to the `say_hello` method, like this:

```ruby
def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}"
end

people = ["Peter", "Paul", "Mary"]

for person in people
  say_hello person
end
```

This will print the same output as the previous slide, but what happens here is that we create the Array with each of the names and then we use the `for` keyword to create a loop. `for` will assign the value in the first element of the array in the variable `people` to a **local variable** called `person` and then execute the body of the for loop. In the body of the for loop, we call the `say_hello` method, passing the value of `person`, which is `"Peter"`, as the argument.

After the body is executed once, the next value in the array, `"Paul"`, is assigned to `person` and the body of the for loop is executed again. This process repeats until the body of the for loop has been executed with the last element of the Array.

For loops and methods are similar in that they both have local variables and a body that is executed with those local variables set. The difference is that the body of a method is only executed once for each time you call it, whereas the body of a for loop is executed once for each element of the Array.

---

# Updating the Array

Using a for loop instead of multiple calls to the method is better because the code will work with any number of elements in the Array. Without a loop, we have to know ahead of time exactly how many names there will be and the program can only work with exactly those values. Here's an example where we add another element to the array

```ruby
def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

people = ["Peter", "Paul", "Mary"]
people << "Bob"

for person in people
  say_hello person
end
```

Now all 4 names are printed. You can imagine in a more complex program we might have to get the names from a database or some external source. In that case, the number of the names will change while our program is running, so we need the flexibility of a for loop.
